# set up a quantitiative research question

What is a relationship for those male and female engineering students between the overall average score of the professional evaluation with formulation of engineering projects and mathematics in Colombia.

# Data Explorsion
Dependent variable: g_sc: the overall average score of the professional evaluation  
Independent variables: 
1. fep_pro: Formulation of Engineering Projects
2. mat_s11 (Mathematics: only one subject for the two periods, check whether it impacts the global scores g_sc.)
3. gender (binary: F/M)  ---- before need to check whether differences

1. Reporting the results with Cohenâ€™s d effect
An independent-samples t-test was conducted to the overall average score of the professional evaluation (g_sc) for female and male students. There is a slight Significant difference in the scores for the overall average score of the professional evaluation  was found (M=161.28, SD=22.33 for female students, M=163.69, SD=23.58 for male students), t(12409)=-5.72, p-value < 0.001). Cohen's d also indicated a small effect size (-0.10). 

2. Reporting the results with eta squared effect
An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare to the overall average score of the professional evaluation (g_sc) for female and male students. There is a slight Significant difference in the scores for the overall average score of the professional evaluation was found (M=161.28, SD=22.33 for female students, M=163.69, SD=23.58 for male students), t(12409)=-5.72, p-value < 0.001). A small effect size was also indicated by the eta squared value (0.003).

Reporting Results of partical correlation
```
Partial correlation was used to explore the relationship between the global score (as measured by g_sc) and mathmatics while controlling for scores on formulation of engineering projects (fep_pro).Preliminary analyses were performed to ensure no violation of the assumption of normality, linearity and homoscedasticity. There was a stong, positive partial correlatin between, the global scores, mathmatics and the scores on formulation of engineering projects, (r=0.57, n=12,411, p<0.001). An inspection of the zero-order correlation (r=0.26) suggested that the scores on formulation of engineering projects had very little effect on the strength of the relationship between these two variables.

Collinearity Note:
Occurs when two or more independent variables contain strongly redundant information.
If variables are collinear then it means there is not enough distinct information in these variables for MLR to operate â€“ they are essentially measuring the same thing. 
if we conduct MLR with collinear variables then the model will produce invalid results
Need to check for collinearity by examining a correlation matrix that compares your independent variables with each other.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

Non-Zero Report for model 2:
The data also met the assumption of non-zero variances (Formulation of Engineering Projects = 1610.13; Mathematics = 140.98, sex=0.24)

```{r, echo=TRUE}

the result show no Multicollinearity. vif: 1.08, 1.11, 1.03 < 2.5, tolerance 0.93, 0.90, 0.97 > 0.4

Report for colliearity of model 2:
Tests to see if the data met the assumption of collinearity indicated that multicollinearity was not a concert(Formulation of Engineering Projects, Tolerance=0.93, VIF=1.08; Mathematics, Tolerance=0.90, VIF=1.11; Sex, Tolerance=0.97, VIF=1.03).

Report outliers for model 3:
An analysis of standard residuals was carried out on the data to identify any outliers, which indicated two cases for concern which were deleted.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# leverage points: An observation that has a value of x that is far away from the mean of x
car::leveragePlots(mmodel_3)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#Assess homocedasticity: ZRESID y vs ZPRED x
# ZPRED (the standardized predicted values of the dependent variable based on the model). These values are
# standardized forms of the values predicted by the model.

# ZRESID (the standardized residuals, or errors). These values are the standardized differences between the
# observed data and the values that the model predicts).

Report for Random Normal Distribution of errors for model 3:
The histogram of standardized residuals indicated that the data contained normally distributed errors, as did the normal Q-Q plot of standardized residuals, which showed most points were extremely close to the line.
